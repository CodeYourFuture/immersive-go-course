# Infrastructure Management

In this project, we will build the infrastructure to run a service in AWS. The infrastructure will be defined in code via Terraform. We will learn how to build, change and destroy our infra in a safe, reproducible way.

Timebox: X days

Learning objectives:

- Create an autoscaling group, security group, load balancer in Terraform
- Understand how Terraform handles state and fixes discrepancies
- Make a change, deploy it, and then revert it
