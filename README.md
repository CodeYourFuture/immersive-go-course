# Let's go!

An immersive, introductory course to backend software engineering using [go](https://go.dev).

## Requirements

Before you start this course, make sure you've followed all of the instructions in the [prep](prep/README.md) section.

Remember: you can _always_ Google or ask for help if you get stuck.

## Projects

This course is structured into self-contained projects that you can work through at your own pace.

Each project has its own directory with a README.md file that has instructions. If you want to take a look at one way of completing an exercise, there's some code waiting on a branch prefixed `impl/` (for "implementation") and an associated [Pull Request](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/pulls) for you to look at. Try not to copy!
