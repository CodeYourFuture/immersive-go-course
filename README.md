# Let's go!

An immersive, introductory course to backend software engineering using [go](https://go.dev).

## Requirements

Before you start this course, there's a few things we assume you've done:

- You're familiar with the essentials of writing code in JavaScript
- You have experience with JavaScript in the browser and in [Node][node]
- You've completed the [Tour of Go][tourofgo]

This is important because we don't cover the basic language features of Go: you need to be familiar with writing Go functions and methods, plus the basics of types in Go. You'll also need to to navigate [packages and documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/).

Remember: you can _always_ Google or ask for help if you get stuck.

## Projects

This course is structured into self-contained projects that you can work through at your own pace.

Each project has its own directory with a README.md file that has instructions. If you want to take a look at one way of completing an exercise, there's some code waiting in an associated [Pull Request](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/pulls) for you to look at. Try not to copy!
