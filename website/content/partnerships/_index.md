# Partnerships

CYF+ is an immersive education programme involving guided independent study and a work placement.

We partner with top-of-industry tech companies to hire excellent diverse and disadvantaged people into junior roles where they thrive.

Previously we have run this programme to train software-engineering focused SREs, and we can support other software- and data-engineering focused roles.

## Who is Code Your Future?

[Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/) is an established charity based primarily in the UK providing a year-long part-time bootcamp to get disadvantaged people into good jobs in tech. (See the [curriculum overview for the main course](https://deploy-preview-530--cyf-curriculum.netlify.app/overview/).)  <!--TODO: Link to a deployed version of this overview when there is one-->

The CYF+ programme aims to take our top performing graduates and get them into the very top of the industry.

Code Your Future has already helped over 250 people start engineering careers. This is truly transformative for our graduates - 83% were below the poverty line, 41% are women, and we have a strong focus on refugees from countries such as Iran, Syria, Palestine, Turkey, Ukraine, Eritrea, and Afghanistan.

Our bootcamp has 70% employment rates within 6 months of graduation, and is proud to achieve 95% job retention after 2 years. People love hiring our graduates, and those graduates succeed.

```

CYF+ recruits from the graduates of the main Code Your Future course - this means we know the existing knowledge of our trainees, and have established relationships with them.

We filter those graduates down to a number our hiring partner is happy to inteview, and the hiring partner decides who to accept into the programme.

Because of their backgrounds, our trainees typically have full-time jobs and caring responsibilities. Once they're accepted onto CYF+, we start paying them to be able to learn full-time.

Our trainees spend 3 months intensively learning skills specific to the jobs the hiring partner is offering.

After 3 months of learning, they start a 9 month internship at the hiring partner. They still get mentorship from their CYF mentors through this time to help them settle in, on-board, and succeed.

At the end of this 9 month internship, you're going to want to convert your interns to full-time, but you're not required to do so - if there's not head count available, that's ok - there are no promise made about long-term full-time jobs.

## What CYF+ offers

The core offering of CYF+ is to de-risk hiring high-potential junior engineers from diverse backgrounds into high-impact jobs.

CYF has significant experience with curriculum and project design, world-class talent as volunteers, and amazing mentors who know how to support people grow from wherever they are to where they need to be.

The CYF+ curriculum (which is open source) has been put together by experienced software engineers from the top of the industry with work experience at Google, Amazon, Twitter, Slack, Apple, and more, including [one of the co-authors of The Google SRE Book](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-nolan-bb7429/).

The broader CYF community includes professional curriculum developers and teachers, and mentors to hundreds of successful trainees.

Our aim is to transition from 100% CYF mentorship at the start of the programme, to partner-led mentorship by the time of full-time conversion. We have experienced mentors who will make sure the trainees are thriving, and we want to fold in hiring-partner mentors as early as possible. We can help your team to improve their mentorship skills as needed, and we act as a safety net to make sure the trainee is on a trajectory to success.

## What CYF+ teaches

CYF+ caters its curriculum to the needs of the specific hiring partner. In 2023 [we partnered with Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/slack-cyf-plus-engineering-employment-pathways-refugees) to hire two SREs for their Demand Engineering team, so put together projects and material focusing on distributed systems thinking, troubleshooting, and handling scale and failure, as well as using Go as the main programming language. [You can see the content of the first run's course here](https://deploy-preview-152--cyf-systems.netlify.app/versions/flattened/1-0-0/). <!--TODO: Link to a deployed version when merged.-->

The course will always include:
* Quality code - making conscious decisions about what the best, most readable, most maintainable way to write code is.
* Distributed systems thinking - state, failure, reliability, etc.
* Working in existing codebases - understanding and debugging code they didn't write.
* Troubleshooting - how to work in an environment where many systems are black boxes you don't know the details of.
* Handling scale and failure - concurrency, error handling, retry strategies, sources of risk and failure.

Additionally we can tailor specific topics or projects to the specific needs of a company or team.

## What CYF+ needs from partners

* A collaborative attitude to understanding what knowledge and experience new-hires will need, and how best to supply them.
* A commitment to hire at least 2 excellent junior engineers on a 9-month internship, including paying their salary and providing a supportive mentoring environment.
* A contribution to Code Your Future of at least £20,000 per hire to support mentoring, training, and course development costs.

## CYF+'s track record

**100% successful employment**

CYF+ has run one cohort with Slack, where both participants were converted to full-time employees just 6 months into their internships.

  Rita graduated from CYF+ in 2023 and is now a full-time SRE at Slack. Before enrolling in the main CYF course in 2022, she had no background or experience in writing software. She should write some things about how meaningful this experience has been for her, and how it has impacted her life.  <!--TODO: Fill this in-->

  I learned about CYF during a very difficult time in my life right at the peak of the pandemic, when I thought there was no hope. Almost 3 years later, I’m now working as a Site Reliability Engineer at Slack and it's all thanks to CYF, CYF+, and the amazing volunteers that work tirelessly to help students become engineers. For me, CodeYourFuture isn't just a bootcamp, it's a community where everyone is welcome regardless of their background or situation.
