## What is CYF+?

CYF+ is full time, remote, immersive engineering programme to prepare and place high-performing [CYF trainees](https://codeyourfuture.io) at high-performing tech companies. The programme is nine months in total, comprising three months of immersive study followed by six months placement with a partner company.

Our syllabus forms a spine of practical software engineering, focused on problem solving, reasoning about code, and communicating with others. We create encounters with the problems of pace, scale and complexity that set high-performing companies apart.
All our projects are developed by engineers with substantial experience of very large systems.
