## What are these workbooks?

We run this programme at [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io) in sprints, currently two week sprints. These workbooks are given to CYF+ Fellows to help them plan their work each sprint.

You are welcome to use them too.

We compile our workbooks into a syllabus iteration, [Versions](../versions/), but you can use them in your own way if you like.

### I should plan my work???

1. Fork the [CYF+ Immersive Repo](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course)
2. Create a new project board on your forked repo. Here's an [example board](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/45/views/1) you can copy.
3. On sprint planning day, go through your workbook and create tickets on your board.

Make estimations of time, priority, and add your tickets to the right sprint iteration. Your time estimations will be wrong, so make sure you update your tickets and learn from the error!
