# Provisional start date: 6 May 2024

## Consolidation

- [ ] [Multiple servers](../../projects/multiple-servers) Revisit this project and deploy it with Docker and GH Actions

## Managing state at scale

- [ ] Read about [Distributed Systems: State](../../primers/distributed-software-systems-architecture/state)
- [ ] Do this HashiCorp tutorial. It will give you hands-on experience with seeing health checks can be used to manage failure. https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/introduction-chaos-engineering?in=consul/resiliency
- [ ] Demonstrate circuit breaking with this HashiCorp tutorial: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/service-mesh-circuit-breaking?in=consul/resiliency
- [ ] See different kinds of load-balancing algorithms in use with this HashiCorp tutorial: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/load-balancing-envoy?in=consul/resiliency
- [ ] Do this tutorial which demonstrates autoscaling with minikube (you will need to install minikube on your computer if you donâ€™t have it). It will give you hands-on experience in configuring autoscaling, plus some exposure to Kubernetes configuration.  
      You may need to run this command first: minikube addons enable metrics-server

## Command line familiarity

- [ ] [Linux Bash I](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Linux/linux_tips2_bash.php) & [Linux Bash II](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Linux/linux_bash_2.php) (There are other blog posts in the same series that could be useful to go through in spare time, would recommend running the commands that the blog post suggests for better understanding.)

## Troubleshooting

- [ ] [Troubleshooting Primer](../../primers/troubleshooting/)
