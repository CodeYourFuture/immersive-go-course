# Prep

The CYF+ Immersive Engineering Programme is an intensive three month course. There's a lot to get through and you'll need to hit the ground running. To prepare for this exciting opportunity, you will:

## Linux

- [ ] Play [the Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) - you must be able to complete up to level 20 (repeatedly)
- [ ] Take this [Unix 101 course](https://www.opsschool.org/unix_101.html) (and then try 102)
- [ ] Print out this [Linux-Cheat-Sheet](https://www.loggly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Linux-Cheat-Sheet-Sponsored-By-Loggly.pdf)

## Go

- [ ] Learn the basics of the Go programming language: [Get Started - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/learn/)
- [ ] Read this, you might find it useful for working through your first projects: [How to use the fmt package in Golang](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-use-the-fmt-package-in-golang)
- [ ] And optionally [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
- [ ] Read the [Pointers chapter](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/8) of [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro), and do the problems listed in the chapter.
- [ ] Read about [stack and heap memory](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2022/resources/stack-heap/) - note that the examples here are C++ not Go, but you should be able to follow them. One important difference between these languages is that in Go, you don't need to worry about whether a value lives on the heap or the stack (in fact, Go is allowed to choose where your variable lives, and even move it around) - this means that it's ok to return a pointer to a stack variable in Go. You also don't need to call `delete` yourself in Go - Go is [a garbage collected language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) so it will delete variables when they're no longer needed.

## Tooling
- [ ] [Set up and get to know your IDE](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/tree/main/prep#set-up-and-get-to-know-your-ide)
- [ ] [Learnt how to navigate Go documentation](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/tree/main/prep#learn-how-to-navigate-go-documentation)

## Projects

Complete the prep and first _two_ projects from the [Immersive Go](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course) course

- [ ] [Prep](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/tree/main/prep)
- [ ] [CLI Files](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/tree/main/projects/cli-files)
- [ ] [http-auth](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/tree/main/projects/http-auth)

## Reading

Dip in to some longer books, but don't feel you need to read the whole lot!

- [ ] [Google - Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)
- [ ] [The Unix Tools Philosophy](https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/gnu_linux_tools_guide/the-unix-tools-philosophy.html)
- [ ] [The Phoenix Project](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business-Anniversary/dp/B00VBEBRK6/)
