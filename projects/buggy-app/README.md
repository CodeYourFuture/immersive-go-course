forhugo-->

In this project, you're going to run, debug, and fix a buggy application. This code here is a "notes" application with users and notes. It simulates a real-world application that has grown and developed over time: the code isn't perfect, there are tests missing and it contains bugs. The task is to find and fix these bugs. There are _at least_ 5 distinct and important bugs for you to find a fix.

> **Note:** This project requires you to have Docker with [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, we use a YAML file to configure the application’s services. Then, with a single command, we create and start all the services from the configuration.

## Learning objectives:

- How can we quickly read, understand and fix existing application code?
- How do we QA running code by thinking about security, edge cases and performance?
- How do we ensure safe data access with authentication & authorisation?
- What are some common architectures for services in tech companies?

## Project

The goal is to find and fix at least 5 bugs. There are issues in the logic, performance, and authorisation (that we know about). There could be more! Find and fix as many as you can in the time.

- Read the documentation below carefully to understand the application's intended behaviour (Idea: write down what you find as you read)
- Read the code to identify how the main pieces fit together and work
- Make sure the main features work
- Identify and test the access controls and [edge cases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case)

### Output

To capture the bugs you find, fork this repository and open an issue for each bug. The issue you open should be a high-quality bug report, containing:

- A summary of the issue
- Information about your setup (operating system, how you were running it)
- Steps to replicate the issue
- The expected result
- The _actual_ result you saw as a result of the bug
- Evidence of the issue (e.g. screenshots or command output)

As an extension, open a Pull Request against your repository that fixes each issue, one PR per issue. You can [link a Pull Request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) too.

### Getting started

Here are a couple of bug reports to get you started - feel free to read them if you want some ideas, or to save them for after you've done some bug hunting if you'd prefer:

<details><summary>Bug report #1</summary>An (imaginary) user of our app has reported that the note "#Monday Remember to take time for self-care" was behaving strangely... the tags didn't look right.</details>
<details><summary>Bug report #2</summary>Another user reported a bug where they deactivated their account, but were still able to see their notes. What's going on there?</details>

## Notes App

There are two services and a database in this project:

1. API service: authenticate and get notes over HTTP
1. Auth service: gRPC service for verifying authentication information
1. Database: Postgres storing users and notes

Here's how requests flow through the architecture diagram below:

1. An HTTP request hits API service with HTTP basic auth
1. The API uses the Auth Client to check the authentication information
1. Auth Client calls Auth Service over gRPC, which verifies credentials against User table in the database
1. Once validated, the API allows request to continue to retrieve Note data from the database

## API

- `GET /1/my/notes.json` -- Get all notes owned by the authenticated user
- `GET /1/my/notes/:id.json` -- Get a specific note owned by the authenticated user

Authentication is by [basic auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication):

```console
> curl 127.0.0.1:8090/1/my/notes.json \
	-H 'Authorization: Basic QTJSUHE2VG86YmFuYW5h' -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/json
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 2022 09:45:03 GMT
Content-Length: 162

{"notes":[{"id":"JBmytGF3","owner":"A2RPq6To","content":"Example note content with tags #example and #another","created":"2022-10-15T19:48:19.597524Z","modified":"2022-10-15T19:48:19.597524Z", "tags": ["example", "another"]}]}
```

The API exposes the "tags" associated with a Note. These are not stored, but are extracted as notes are read from the database.

## Database

The database is Postgres. This is the table structure:

### `user`

- `id`: primary key: randomly generated string, like `A2RPq6To`
- `status`: string (`inactive` or `active`)
- `password`: bcrypt string
- `created`: timestamp
- `modified`: timestamp

Users with status `inactive` should not be able to authenticate or access their notes.

### `note`

- `id`: primary key: randomly generated string, like `JBmytGF3`
- `owner`: foreign key for a user
- `content`: text, contents of the Note
- `created`: timestamp
- `modified`: timestamp

Users should not be able to access notes that they do not own.

## Structure

Here's what each directory contains:

- `api`: The HTTP API service
  - `model`: Code for interacting with notes in the database
- `assets`: Static files relating to the application (e.g. `.monopic` architecture file)
- `auth`: The Auth service that verifies authentication information supplied to the API service, and an Client that the API service uses to talk to the Auth service
  - `cache`: A caching package that stores previously verified authentication information
  - `service`: Protocol Buffer code (`.proto` and generated `.go`) for the gRPC service
- `bin`: Executable scripts that are used within the Dockerfile
- `cmd`: Command line tools for running the application, setting up the database and generating data for testing
  - `api`: Run the API service
  - `auth`: Run the Auth service
  - `migrate`: Set up the database. See [Migrations](#migrations) below.
- `migrations`: `sql` files for the migrations, setting up `user` and `note` tables
- `util`: Shared code across the other directories
- `volumes`: Directories that will be mounted into the containers
  - `init`: [Scripts for initialising the Postgres database](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md#initialization-scripts)
  - `secrets`: Created when the app is run. Contains secrets such as the `postgres` user password.

In addition there are some important files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration for `docker compose`, specifying how the database, services, migrations and tests run within docker
- `Dockerfile`: Build configuration for the application. The whole repository is built with the same `Dockerfile` configuration, with different commands available (those in the `cmd` directory). See the `docker-compose.yml` file for details on how each service actually runs.
- `Makefile`: Commands for setting-up, testing, migrating, and running the application. The important commands are:
  - `migrate`: Runs migrations against Postgres. May also do initialisation if required.
  - `test`: Runs tests. May also do initialisation if required.
  - `build-run`: Builds and runs the whole application.

## Running

Use `make build run`:

```console
> make build run
...
buggy-app-postgres-1  | 2022-10-16 09:41:48.815 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
buggy-app-auth-1      | wait-for-it.sh: postgres:5432 is available after 1 seconds
buggy-app-auth-1      | 2022/10/16 09:41:48 auth service: listening: :80
buggy-app-api-1       | wait-for-it.sh: postgres:5432 is available after 1 seconds
buggy-app-api-1       | 2022/10/16 09:41:49 api service: listening: :80
```

Once it's running, the port of the API will be available (`8090`) which we can see via `docker compose ps`:

```console
> docker compose ps
NAME                   COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
buggy-app-api-1        "/bin/docker-entrypo…"   api                 running             127.0.0.1:8090->80/tcp
buggy-app-auth-1       "/bin/docker-entrypo…"   auth                running             127.0.0.1:8080->80/tcp
buggy-app-postgres-1   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   postgres            running             0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
```

Under the hood, we're using `docker compose` to coordinate startup.

`bin/wait-for-it.sh` is used extensively to make sure that Postgres is available before the other services are started.

We can also re-run everything without rebuilding: `make run`

## Tests

To run the tests of this project, run:

```console
> make test
...
ok  	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/api	2.051s
?   	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/api/model	[no test files]
ok  	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/auth	5.974s
ok  	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/auth/cache	0.002s
?   	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/auth/service	[no test files]
?   	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/cmd/api	[no test files]

?   	github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/buggy-app/util/authuserctx	[no test files]
```

**Important:** the tests run **inside Docker** and rely on a fully [migrated](#Migrations) Postgres. Always running via `make` should ensure this is the case.

## Migrations

In this context, database migrations are SQL files (`.sql`) that specify how the data should be setup. They are ordered, and the order is very important: each migration file builds on the previous migrations so that we get a fully working database state at the end. The migration files are used to set up database tables, plus functions and triggers for generating random IDs.

Each migration has an "up" and "down" script which performs the migration and undoes it, respectively.

The migration process is performed by the code in `cmd/migrate` using the [migrate package](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

To run migrations:

```console
> make migrate
...
2022/10/16 10:17:19 migrate: "file:///migrations/app" into "app" database
...
2022/10/16 10:17:19 migrate: complete
```

**Important:** the migrations run **inside Docker**. Always run them via `make`.

## Test data

You can generate test data using `cmd/test`. There are two commands, `user` and `note`. These are useful for setting up test scenarios. The database needs to be running: `make run`.

```console
> go run ./cmd/test user -password banana
	2022/10/16 16:40:56 new user created
	2022/10/16 16:40:56 	id: FxoAB2gl
	2022/10/16 16:40:56 	password: banana
	2022/10/16 16:40:56 base64 for auth: RnhvQUIyZ2w6YmFuYW5h

> go run ./cmd/test note -owner FxoAB2gl
	2022/10/16 16:41:42 new note created
	2022/10/16 16:41:42 	id: 0fxh25SJ
	2022/10/16 16:41:42 	owner: FxoAB2gl
	2022/10/16 16:41:42 	content: "Example note content"
```

### `user`

Example that generates 3 `active` users with the password `banana`.

```console
> go run ./cmd/test user -password banana -status inactive -n 3
2022/10/16 21:19:48 new user created
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	id: VcKtJ4Nx
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	status: inactive
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	password: banana
2022/10/16 21:19:48 base64 for auth: VmNLdEo0Tng6YmFuYW5h
2022/10/16 21:19:48 new user created
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	id: 73AY1VfS
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	status: inactive
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	password: banana
2022/10/16 21:19:48 base64 for auth: NzNBWTFWZlM6YmFuYW5h
2022/10/16 21:19:48 new user created
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	id: TnKZvNFl
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	status: inactive
2022/10/16 21:19:48 	password: banana
2022/10/16 21:19:48 base64 for auth: VG5LWnZORmw6YmFuYW5h
```

Usage of `user`:

```
  -db string
		target database (default "app")
  -hostport string
		host:port of Postgres (default "localhost:5432")
  -n int
		number of entities to generate (default 1)
  -password string
		password of the created user (default "password")
  -status string
		status of the created user (default "active")
```

### `note`

Example that generates 3 notes, owned by user `TnKZvNFl`, with the content `This note has a #tag`.

```console
> go run ./cmd/test note -owner TnKZvNFl -content "This note has a #tag" -n 3
2022/10/16 21:21:01 new note created
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	id: 7_sI25qa
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	owner: TnKZvNFl
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	content: "This note has a #tag"
2022/10/16 21:21:01 new note created
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	id: 2hcmUDzb
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	owner: TnKZvNFl
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	content: "This note has a #tag"
2022/10/16 21:21:01 new note created
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	id: dcd9kMNo
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	owner: TnKZvNFl
2022/10/16 21:21:01 	content: "This note has a #tag"
```

Usage of `note`:

```
  -content string
		content of the created note (default "Example note content")
  -db string
		target database (default "app")
  -hostport string
		host:port of Postgres (default "localhost:5432")
  -n int
		number of entities to generate (default 1)
  -owner string
		owner of the created note
```
