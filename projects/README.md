## Requirements

Before you start this course, make sure you've read and followed all of the instructions in the [prep](../prep/README.md) document. This will get you set up and explain how to work through the projects.

Remember: you can _always_ Google or ask for help if you get stuck.

## Projects

This course is structured into self-contained projects that you can work through at your own pace.

Each project has its own directory with a README.md file that has instructions. If you want to take a look at one way of completing an exercise, there's some code waiting on a branch prefixed `impl/` (short for "implementation") and an associated [Pull Request](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/immersive-go-course/pulls) for you to look at. Try not to copy!

Most exercises finish with a list of optional extension tasks. It's highly recommended that you try them out. Note that often the extensions are open-ended and under-specified - make sure to think about them with a curious mind: Why are they useful? What trade-offs do they have?
