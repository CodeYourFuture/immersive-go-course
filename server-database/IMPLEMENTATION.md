# Server and database

In this project, you'll build another server. This one will have a simple API that serves data in JSON form. You'll then convert the backend to read from a Postgres database, serving data for the API. You'll then turn off the database and learn how to handle errors correctly.

Timebox: 6 days

Learning objectives:

- Build a simple API server that talks JSON
- Understand how a server and a database work together
- Use SQL to read data from a database
- Accept data over a POST request and write it to the database
